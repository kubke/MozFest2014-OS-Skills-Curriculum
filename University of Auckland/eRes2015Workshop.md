eRes 2015 Workshop
------------------

This is about moderizing and improving science practice.

We are building a course to address a failure at the level of university/postgrad trainging when it comes to modern digital research skills. 

> be clear about the target audience for the modules, and try to avoid discussions about how, when, where we can teach, uniovesoty practices, grumbles etc. The digital skills, tools, and resources at a general level is what we want to focus on today.

Towards such aims we are developing a series of OER "modules" which can be flexible utilised in various guises amongst a range of university offerings - summer schools, 700 level courrses, academic developemt courses and workshops, U21 offerings etc.

In this session we want to 
	- brainstorm/feedback on the selection on the modules
	- identify the key skills for each module
	- identify exemplar tools/technologies, and what resources exist for teaching or using these tools (keeping to teh OER model)

The focus here is on identifying skills, technologies and exemplar use or materials for the teaching of these.
The pedagogy (how we will teach it) - we will take care of later.



First thoughts for the workshop.
-------

1) What we are here for
2) Introductions (split people into modulo groups? - talk to your neighbour about the last time you helped someone or were frustrated with a digital tool in research)
3) The modules and discussion - 3 sticky note system
4) Design sheets - capture knowledge/experience >> needs effort in desing to capture the knowlege we want.
5) Free time - while we collate the main ideas
6) Group feedback and review on collated notes
7) Session feedback on post-its. 1+ 1-

Have an etherpad running for all to drop notes as we go along.
Put details of how to contribute or follow along here to.

Design sheets.
---
group or indiv?
Pick a module and put it in the middle - fill out around it - bullet points are fine.

Design questions
-
variation on badge design canvas
- what skills or knowledge are important for the module
- what behaviours (see inquiry venn) do these skills and knowledge encourage
- value proposition > why bother to learn these skills, what opportunites do they afford
- what criteria could be used to demonstrate basic competence or understanding of these skills in practice
- are there realted skills or modules are also relevant or partially overlap
- which tools or technologies are commonly used, relevant to real scenarios, or represent good choices for learners
- what resources or exemplars exist to help in the teaching or understanding of this modules skills and knowledge
