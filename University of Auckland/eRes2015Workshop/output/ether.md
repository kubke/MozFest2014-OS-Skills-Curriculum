Digital Literacy Reproducible, Open & Collaborative Science (ROCS)
25 March 2015
Cam: A series of OER modules that can be flexibly combined. Aimed at university-level courses (broadly defined), for researchers that don't have a tonne of digital experience.
Task one: warm-up discussion on solving computer-related problems. 
Cam: Outlines six modules. Feedback from group: what's missing? what's more or less important? We also want to know what skills are needed - what skills and tools are needed? 
Task two: look at course modules. Write as many bullet points on gaps that we have missed or improved from what we have so far. 
Groups Feedback
* Scientific computer --> research computing
* Thing overview module needed - Digital Literacy 101 that touched briefly on all other modules
* beginner / intermediate / advanced versions needed
* Programming is missing! Digital literacy should include programming. 
* Maybe just theories of programming, data structure - people should be able to explain to others what they want to compute - you need to speak pseudo-code
* Social media spread across the modules
* Visualisation
* Linux basics - it needs the basics of open science AND open source.
* Security and access management is no there; locking people out is also important
* Validation (as a broader category than unit testing)
* Analytics
* Does digital literacy assume information literacy?
* Discovering - how to get into and know your domain
* Disciplines have their own training in methodologies - how much should these be included in these general module? 
* Revision control
* Life cycles  - including end of life for a project
* Research life cycle needs to be included
* Systems administration
* Optimising in a parallel universe 
Task three: So, we have lots of ideas. But which are the most important? 
Fabiana discusses the context: this needs to be modular. We are not trying to make people into Computer Scientists; we want them to have literacy in the necessary digital skills they need. Discussion on the different needs of various disciplines. 
Suggestion that each group pick a disciplinary persona and form priorities on that basis. 
#1 Fresh faced PhD student, excited but unsure
     1. Research Communication
     2. Digital research skills, including discovery; data management could be included there. Note-keeping - suggestion that is included in the overview module
     3. Where to start - very basic introduction. 
#2 Humanites - Art History/Digital Media
    1. Collaboration github, etc.  Teaching students to collaborate with advisors, despite onus to do own research.
    2. Data management - same as #1. 
#3 Education Researchers (ticked many options - missed a few!)
    1. Automation and Scale; Scripting; Basic HPC; reproducible workflows
    2. 
    3.Graphics
    4. Licensing
    5. Orchidd
    6. Collab groupware
#4. No persona
    1. Basic scripting
    2. Computer graphics / info-viz
    3 also spoken and written language - too technically specific to communicate to others. Change language to other audiences. 
    
#5. No persona - librarians! 
    1. Ticked everything under data managemebnt
    2. Reproducibility
    3. Visualisation. (Missed one)
--> difficult to know in some areas how deep students should go into some of these issues - i.e some literacy required, but not expert. 
    
Task four. What tools are needed to teach these skills? All tools need to be tied to a skill. 
[Will add from notes laterr]
Discussion:
* Uncovering tacit assumptions. Basic searchability and discoverability. Knowing how to ask the right questions is more important. When someone gets to PhD, we often make assumptions about whether they have these skills. Also issue of modelling best behaviour for students. It's essential to know how to ask questions of local experts, and know what to do with their answers and put them to use. 
* It's possible to cover these issues quite quickly in a teaching situation if you do it by example. Don't teach validation, demonstrate validation - so you don't have to labour over it. Learn by doing. 
* Demonstration also makes it less scary for people, who often think they can't understand quite technical subjects
* Drill into where you want to pitch these modules. Be clear of student outcomes. 
* where you want to pitch these modules. Be clear of student outcomes. 
* Do mini-research project over a few weeks in a course, and model these skills. You can go through the research cycle
* Modelling Collaboration
* Could this be MOOC'd. (Cam: that is definitely possible). 
* Why is this a postgrad course? This is just as important to undergrad. (Fab: teaching environment is different, because the student numbers are so great - so it's an overhead problem. 300 students, 15 tutors needed). 
* One way around overhead issue is to use Pond - introduce to high school teachers (Fab: problem with structure of undergrad courses).
* Academic integrity course as one example / model - every student does it at UoA. MOOC could 
* Difficulties of collaboration.
