eRes 2015 Workshop
------------------

This is about moderizing and improving science practice.

We are building a course to address a failure at the level of university/postgrad trainging when it comes to modern digital research skills. 

> The course is targeted at late undergrad/early postgrad students who intend to enter into research. For today we are going to try and avoid discussions about how, when, where we can teach, university practices, pedagogy, and all the various grumbles you migh have etc. 

> The digital skills, tools, and resources at a general level is what we want to focus on today.

Towards such aims we are developing a series of OER "modules" which can be flexibly utilized in various guises amongst a range of university offerings - summer schools, 700 level courses, academic development courses and workshops, U21 offerings etc.

In this session we want to 
	- brainstorm and seek feedback on the selection and relative importance of these modules
	- identify the key skills for each module
	- identify exemplar tools/technologies, and what resources might exist for teaching or using these tools (keeping to the OER model)

Again, the focus here is on identifying skills, technologies and exemplar use or materials for the teaching of these.
The pedagogy (how we will teach it) - we will take care of later.


Further notes/ideas on the bigger picture.
-----
How to prepare students to work effectively with digital technologies.
What are the students expectations?
Show how to transfer skills to academic practice.
Make it clear which technologies can support which research activities.
Build student confidence.
Offer authentic exepriences.
Context will of course determine which modules are appropriate for which course of study or discipline.
Create learning and assessment activities which require students to use digital tech to
	- communicate ideas
	- express views
	- produce artifacts
	- analyse data
	- solve problems 
Be clear about how we expect students to use digital tech i their programmes of learning.


Plan for the workshop.
-------

1) What we are here for? Explain the above and the structure for the next hour. Etherpad. Trello. Github.
We want to collect as many comments/thoughts/ideas/opinions - we are not trying to reach consensus.
Were gonna try and write a lot of things down - everyone gets a opportunity to have their say, and we can synthesize a bigger picture after the event.

This is open and inclusive - no one persons view is privileged , there is no right or wrong - we're gonna try something like a meta-brain dump, utilize the collective intelligence of the room in a parallel / unrestrained way. :)
> 5min

2) Introductions (split people into modulo groups of 4-5? - talk to your neighbor or group of 3 about the last time you either helped someone, or were frustrated with a digital tool related to research) > Think for 1 minute, capture this on a sticky note (we collect later), talk - 2min each person.
> 5min

3) The modules > display them all (paper or PPT) The modules represent or are related to some core elements of scientific inquiry. We want to map these to digital skills, and then to specific exemplar tools, technologies, resources.
>5min to go through.

On your own - write down...
	- Are there any gaps/modules missing? In your experience?
	- General comments > what do you like/not like about the modules (topic or content)
	- In the context of a semester long University course, try and rank the modules - which are essential, which are optional or expendable ( each person tick, dash, cross next to modules?)
>allow 6min

Now - we're gonna try something - starting with all the 1s in the group, 60seconds to explain your responses to the rest of your group and stick you comments on the A3 sheet. The rest of the group will listen, and if it sparks additional thoughts, ideas, comments - write them down!
Now 2, 3, 4 etc...
>allow 6min (assuming ~5 per group)

Then
>5 more minutes general discussion amongst your group - add to your notes! Then we'll see share as a room what thoughts we have


Each group - report back to room - briefly one item on what's missing, any comments good/bad, top 3 ranked (1,2, or 3)
Capture on board or etherpad
>3min

(30 mins now)

5) Show Revised module list. 

6) Design sheets - capture knowledge/experience >>
	- What in your experience are the key skills, and useful tools/techologies/resources related to each module
	
Each group pick a module - (allow self selection for 'familiar' topics? Should be OK to double up in this session - we want participants to tell us about things they know, not test them on things they dont)

	2 phases

	a) Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities
		- Skills -> What kinds of proficiencies should be developed through training and experience in this module?
		- Knowledge -> What kinds of concepts do you need to know/use to become skilled/practiced in this area?
		
> Instead of thinking of specific tools, ask what is the underlying purpose of these tools?, what practical skills do you need /are associated with them?, what makes the tools useful?.

	b) Tools, technologies, exemplars, resources 
		- List the above your particular module, what good resources or tools exist, what do people use?
		eg Python, Git/Hub, Inkscape, Trello 

(looking for authentic tools, and resources suitable for teaching)
>10mins

	- 60sec rounds, add further comments/notes


10min free discussion in group - document further comments and ideas
>10min

1 min each group - report back - key skill or knowledge, key technology or resources
(50min)

In the remaining time (15-20mins).
Open the floor for any and all discussion on
> modules
> skills
> resources

(capture notes on etherpad)

8) Thnakyou! wrap-up -> Where and how to contribute, follow up, see outcome.
9) Session/workshop feedback on post-its. 1+ 1- comment

Have an etherpad running for all to drop notes as we go along.
Put details of how to contribute or follow along here to.



Design sheets.
---

group or indiv?
Pick a module and put it in the middle - fill out around it - bullet points are fine.

Design questions > 1,2,3,4 > then 10 min free speak.

2 phases
1) Skills, knowledge, and abilities

> if you are thinking of tools, what is th underlying purpose, skills associated, what makes the tools useful.
20mins


2) Tools, technologies, exemplars, resources
>15mins


variation on badge design canvas
- what skills or knowledge are important for the module ? eg...
- what behaviours (see inquiry venn) do these skills and knowledge encourage ?  
- value proposition > why bother to learn these skills, what opportunites do they afford ?
- what criteria could be used to demonstrate basic competence or understanding of these skills in practice ?
- are there realted skills or modules are also relevant or partially overlap ?
- which tools or technologies are commonly used, relevant to real scenarios, or represent good choices for learners ?
- what resources or exemplars exist to help in the teaching or understanding of this modules skills and knowledge  ?
-
